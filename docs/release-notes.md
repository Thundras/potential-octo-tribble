# Release Notes

This document tracks notable changes for each release. Add the newest release at the top.

## Release automation

When a PR is merged into `main`, the workflow bumps the version and creates a GitHub release based on PR labels:

- `release:major` bumps the major version.
- `release:minor` bumps the minor version.
- `release:patch` bumps the patch version (default when no label is present).
